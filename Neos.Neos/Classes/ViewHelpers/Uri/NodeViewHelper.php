/**
 * A view helper for creating URIs pointing to nodes.
 *
 * The target node can be provided as string or as a Node object; if not specified
 * at all, the generated URI will refer to the current document node inside the Fusion context.
 *
 * When specifying the ``node`` argument as string, the following conventions apply:
 *
 * *``node`` starts with ``/``:*
 * The given path is an absolute node path and is treated as such.
 * Example: ``/sites/acmecom/home/about/us``
 *
 * *``node`` does not start with ``/``:*
 * The given path is treated as a path relative to the current node.
 * Examples: given that the current node is ``/sites/acmecom/products/``,
 * ``stapler`` results in ``/sites/acmecom/products/stapler``,
 * ``../about`` results in ``/sites/acmecom/about/``,
 * ``./neos/info`` results in ``/sites/acmecom/products/neos/info``.
 *
 * *``node`` starts with a tilde character (``~``):*
 * The given path is treated as a path relative to the current site node.
 * Example: given that the current node is ``/sites/acmecom/products/``,
 * ``~/about/us`` results in ``/sites/acmecom/about/us``,
 * ``~`` results in ``/sites/acmecom``.
